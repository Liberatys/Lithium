# Sanctuary


Thank you for reading this message. At the moment I'm rewriting Lithium in a new form due, to problems in my initial design that would have made it very difficult to move to the point of usage where I wanted Lithium to be.

Therefore, I'm rewriting all of the code and will introduce a better structure and documentation to the code. During this time, the old code (is not finished and only works to a certain point) can be found as a release on this repository.







I'm working on releasing a new, working and better documentated version soon.
