Welcome to the repository of Lithium. Lithium strives to be a easy and lightweigth tool for creating and maintaing microservices in a distributed fashion. We want to give you the opertunity to create your own implementations of certain tools that are used in the library and can be plugged into a service or a loader balancer.



## What we want to achive

As stated in the first part of the Page, we want to create an easy to use microservice tool that should help people to get up and running with microservices in golang. We want to give the developer the power to use features that we provide or just to overwrite them with his own tools.



## Batteries included

As a easy to use tool, we want to include all the batteries that you could need in order to create your system. So in the future we want to provide the following batteries:
* Logwriter 
* Log Analytics
* Service Discovery
* Load Balancer
* Stress Tester
* Fitness Tracker (For the service not for the developer)
* DDOS Protection
* Secure Connection between Services
* Databaseconnections (probably MYSQL, Cockroach and/or Cassandra)
