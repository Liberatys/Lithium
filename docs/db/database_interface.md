# Database-interface

My aim is, to create an interface for the user that abstracts the connection to the database as well as the execution and preparation of queries. It also should support the most common types of databases.

The main idea of Sancutary and this part of it is, to shift away the boring and configery stuff from the user to the framework. This enables the programmer to create their servies faster and have them deploayed in a fast and easy manner.
